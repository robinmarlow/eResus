## Hypothermia

Mild hypothermia 35-32°Moderate hypothermia 32-28°Severe hypothermia <28°Ideally core temperature should be measured via rectal, oeseophageal or bladder probe.There is a risk of initial temperature drop with vasodilation secondary to heating of peripheries. Initial passive external treatment of hypothermia:Careful handlingRemoval of wet clothesWarm blanketsActive External re-warming:Forced air blanket re-warmerRadiant heatActive internal rewarmingWarmed intravenous fluids (40-44°c)If severe hypothermia or cardiac arrest other active internalrewarming strategies include:Pleural/bladder/stomach/peritoneal lavageExtracorporeal rewarmingcould be considered, but only in cases of extreme cold submersion & when local resources allow. The following modifications to the advanced paediatric life support algorithm (5thedition) should be made in hypothermic cardiac arrest:Only 3 shocks while under 30°cNo cardio-active drugs to be given until rewarmed to 30°c, thereafter the intervals between administration of drugs should be doubled (every 6-10 minutes) until normothermic.
