## Management of severe croup
Minimise agitation/ stress
Nebulised adrenaline (5mls of 1:1000) expect a response within 10 minutes
Oral dexamethasone (0.6mg/kg to max 12mg)
Nebulised budesonide (2mg) if persistent vomiting or respiratory distress prevents oral dexamethasone 
Oxygen if sats < 92%

Severe respiratory distress following adrenaline nebuliser:  

Give 2nd adrenaline nebuliser and move to resus
Contact PICU
Consider alternative diagnosis

Note: Observe all children for 4 hours post adrenaline neb (risk of rebound symptoms)
