Burns
![Burns algorithm](./guidelines.md/burns_algo.png)

## Indications for major trauma call
Burns TBSA ≥20% (consider if ≥10%)
Airway involvement
Multi-trauma 

All burns ≥10% TBSA must be seen and assessed immediately by the burns team.

## Inhalation injury
Risk factors for inhalation injury
Extricated from smoke filled room
Unconscious at time of injury
Burns to face
Soot around mouth/ nose/ in sputum
Hoarse voice

__Early involvement of PICU, anaesthetics and burns team.__

Consider early elective intubation but DO NOT intubate unless essential. If intubating do not cut the tube due to facial swelling. 

## Pain Scoring and analgesia
Cover burns

Oral analgesia
Paracetamol 15 – 20mg/kg (max 1g)
Ibuprofen 5 – 10mg/kg (max 400mg) contraindicated if burns ≥10% TBSA or systemically unwell
Oramorph 200 – 400 micrograms/kg (max 10mg)
Tramadol 1mg/kg (max 100mg)

Intranasal 
Intranasal diamorphine dose > 10kg 100 micrograms/kg (max 10mg) (seek advice if < 1 year)

Intravenous
Morphine 100 – 200 micrograms/kg (seek advice if < 1year)

## BSA and Depth
![Burns algorithm](./guidelines.md/burns2.png)

Assessment of depth is difficult and not necessary for initial management (refer to full guidelines for depth assessment)

Calculate BSA using Lund Browder chart
or [Mersey burns app online](https://app.merseyburns.com/)

Do NOT include superficial burns (erythema only) in %TBSA calculation

## Fluids
Indications for resuscitation and maintenance fluids

\> 1 month scald ≥ 20% TBSA or flame ≥ 10% TBSA
Neonate (< 4 weeks) scald or flame ≥  5%

If >1 month and scald 10 – 19% TBSA do NOT give resuscitation fluids. Give 80% maintenance fluids (discuss route with burns team). 

### Resucitation fluids
   Total volume (Hartmanns)  =  weight (kg)  x  %TBSA  x  2

½ over first 8 hours from injury
½ over next 16 hours
Include fluid boluses already given
Delayed fluid resuscitation do not administer rapid catch up
Adjust according to clinical status. Target UO 0.5 – 1.0 ml/kg (if child well do not chase UO)

### Maintenance  Fluids
IV maintenance fluids only if not tolerating oral fluids or < 12 months
Give 80% maintenance fluids
1st 10kg = 4 ml/kg/hour
2nd 10kg = 2ml/kg/hour
Extra extra kg = 1ml/kg/hour

Check U&Es 8 – 12 hourly
If < 12 months check BM
Consider catheterization
