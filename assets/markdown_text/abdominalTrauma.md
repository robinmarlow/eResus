# Abdominal Trauma

## History Red Flags
- High impact/ deceleration injury
- Direct blow to abdomen
- Evidence of injuries above and below the abdomen
- Seat-belt injuries
- Bicycle handlebar injuries
- Straddle injuries
- Penetrating injury to neck/ chest/ abdomen/ pelvis

## Examination
- Abdomen
- C-spine precautions with minimal handling and 20° tilt if suspected c-spine injury
- Check front and back
- Bruising (seat belt or handlebar marks)
- Abdominal distension 
- Abdominal tenderness 
- Abdominal guarding 
- Pelvic instability or tenderness
  * Pelvic binder in-situ do NOT remove until significant pelvic injury excluded.
  * Do __NOT__ examine for stability.
  * Do __NOT__ log-roll until pelvis cleared 

## Perineum
- Do NOT perform urinary catheterization if
  * Blood at meatus
  * Haematuria since accident
 - If haematuria perform contrast study (retrograde cystogram)
- Blood at meatus or history of haematuria perform retrograde urethrogram before catheterization:
  * Urethrogram positive call on-call surgeon
  * Urethrogram negative catheterize. If haematuria present perform retrograde cystogram 

## Management
ABCDE approach

### Circulation
- Two large bore cannulae
- First fluid bolus 10ml/kg 0.9% saline
- Second fluid bolus 10ml/kg 0.9% saline. Call surgeons
If further boluses required give blood . Activate major hemorrhage protocol
- Give Tranexamic acid
- Consider NGT (unless contraindicated – basal skull #)

[Major Haemorrhage](#majorHaemorrhage.md)

[Pain protocol](#pain.md)

### Investigations
- Bloods – FBC, U&Es, LFTs, amylase, cross-match, BM
- Urine MC+S
- __CT scan is the imaging modality of choice__
- X-rays – primary series 
- Fast USS not routinely used
- No role for peritoneal lavage 

## Indications for Emergency Laparotomy
- Unstable patient following resuscitation, with abdominal trauma
- Evidence of hollow viscus injury (free intraperitoneal air) on imaging
- Retained weapon
- Gunshot wound abdomen
- Evisceration
