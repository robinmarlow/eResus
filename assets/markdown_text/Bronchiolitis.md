Severe Bronchiolitis: Diagnostic criteria and Investigations 

Criteria
SpO2 ≤ 92% in any oxygen
SpO2 ≤ 76% in any oxygen and CHD
Persistent tachypnoea(RR > 70 <6 mths, RR > 60 6 – 12 mths)
Apnoea +/- bradycardia
Severe respiratory distress
Exhaustion
High PEW score

Investigations
NPA
Capillary gas if SpO2 < 92% in FiO2 ≥ 0.5, severe respiratory distress, tiring
CXR if diagnostic uncertainty – persistent fever,  suspected complications, FiO2 ≥ 0.5
Blood tests if starting IV fluids or diagnostic uncertainty  

Consider alternative diagnosis including sepsis (temp > 39C, child looks toxic) and cardiac (murmur, absent femoral pulses, hepatomegaly, sweaty)

Management of severe bronchiolitis
Oxygen Target saturations > 92%
Humidified oxygen via head box oxygen 
IV fluids Indication severe or worsening respiratory distress
0.45% sodium chloride + 5% glucose with 10mmol KCL
Rate 75% maintenance 
Check U&Es 
Respiratory support Heated humidified high flow nasal cannula
[link to optiflow guidelines]
PICU referral Indications respiratory acidosis and pH < 7.3, apnoea, air leak (pneumothorax/ pnuemomediastium), multi-organ failure

Bronchiolitis admission guidelines
Respiratory rate > 50 with moderate-severe recession
Requiring feeding support
Requiring oxygen (saturations < 92% in air)
Apnoeas 
Low threshold for admission
Age < 6 weeks
Preterm (< 35/40)
Low birth weight (< 2.5kg)
Co-morbidity: pre-existing lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular weakness, immunodeficiency, trisomy 21
