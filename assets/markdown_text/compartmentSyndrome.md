# Compartment Syndrome
## Diagnosing Compartment Syndrome
Compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis
Symptoms
Pain (out of proportion to injury)
Paraesthesia
Signs
Increasing analgesia requirements
Agitation
Pain on passive stretch
Neurological changes
Delayed CRT
Dense/ woody compartment
Reduced/ absent pulses

## Measuring Compartment pressures
Indications for measuring compartment pressures 
Obtunded patient
Unclear clinical picture
Do NOT use absolute compartment pressure as a cut-off
Compartment syndrome is likely if difference between MAP and compartment pressure </= 30mmHG
Do NOT use DBP to diagnosis compartment syndrome in children
Pressure monitoring is not indicated when the clinical diagnosis is clear

## Management of Compartment Syndrome
Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency. Once definitively diagnosed, surgical release should be performed urgently (within 1 hour). Surgical treatment should not be delayed for any reason, including starvation status or bed availability. 	
Immediate treatment 
Remove circumferential dressings (keep limb splinted)
Elevate limb
Avoid regional and patient controlled analgesia
Evaluate every 30 minutes if not improving progress to surgical release
Decision for continuous pressure monitoring can only be made by consultant
Surgical treatment dual incision 4 compartment fasciotomy
